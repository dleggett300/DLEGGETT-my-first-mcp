What I built:

I made a task timer tool that allows users to keep track of the time they are spending at work. You can rename tasks, track them live, start and stop them at will and more. You can have multiple tasks running as well.

How Claude helped:

Claude was able to take my ideas and convert them into functional code first-try. So long as I gave specific goals for my tool it was able to to implement them and if I needed ideas or implementation approaches I could ask it for those as well.

-

Some prompts that worked:

"what if I can name the timers and run multiple different timers at once.  
Give me some ideas how to implement"

"add a tool to my work timer MCP called current_timer that lists the live      
running count at the time the tool was called"

-

Debugging journey:

The only real issue I had was testing to make sure my live MCP server on GitHub worked. I asked Claude to help me do some testing and it ended up downloading a copy of the GitHub files and moving them to the wrong folder which made it seem like the MCP server was not working. It only took me a couple minutes to figure that out and once I had put them in the right place everything went smoothly.

How MCP works:

MCP lets AI talk with other programs that AI models don't natively support. It uses tools, which are just like functions that allow an AI model to perform a wider range of tasks. They also do not need to be explicitly called, the AI can understand what you are asking and call the tools when appropriate.

What I would do differently:

Honestly I cannot think of anything I would do differently. It was very easy to work with Claude to set up the MCP server.

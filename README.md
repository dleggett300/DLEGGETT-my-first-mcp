What my MCP does and why it's useful: 

My tool allows for a built-in stopwatch inside Claude. You can run multiple timers concurrently and start/stop any of them at any time. You can also check on the timers while they are still running. This can be useful for future projects so I know how long they took and can give a more accurate time count in my submission.

How to install:

All you have to do is cline the git repo and use npm install to install the dependencies, then make sure the .mcp.json is in the correct folder. Once you restart Claude it will show up.

Usage example:

Working on a project and you want to know how much time you spent on it; you can tell Claude to start a timer for the whole project. Then, if you want to know how much time a specific part of a project took, you can ask Claude to start a second timer and have Claude stop it once you are finished on that portion.

Limitations:

Currently there is no timer history so it cannot be accessed in a new Claude session.
